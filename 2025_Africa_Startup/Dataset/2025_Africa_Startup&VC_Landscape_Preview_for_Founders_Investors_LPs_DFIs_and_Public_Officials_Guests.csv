Through my organization, Primacy Youth Development Initiative, I've had the privilege of launching the African Youth Mentorship project, which has directly addressed educational and economic disparities across Africa, fostering youth leadership and bridging the gap between educational access and market-ready skills.
We have  raised 200 young leaders across 30 African countries, facilitating the education of over 700 secondary school students across 18 schools and 1,400 youths, providing them with valuable skills and knowledge, and placed 12 youths in internships, offering them mentorship and skills needed to access the opportunities in the job market..

Internationally, I have been honored to be part of several humanitarian efforts. As one of the 71 changemakers leading the development of the 2100 Learning Agenda by the United Nations Foundation, I have contributed to shaping the future of education. I've also served as a youth expert consultant for the World Largest Lesson project hosted by UNICEF and UNESCO , and spoken at various events hosted by renowned organizations. 

My role as social media lead changemaker for the People Action group of the Our Future Agenda's Engine room, powered by the UNF, has allowed me to amplify the voices of young people and promote meaningful change. Being appointed as a UNF creator for the Summit of the Future 2024 and recognized as a Global Peace Influential scholar for 2023 has further solidified my commitment to humanitarian work. In December 2024, I received the Bloom 30under30 social impact global award.

Of the ones that do, more than half are in non-engineering roles. I am a graduate of Mechanical Engineering, and even though I was among the few who seemed to have had it easy, thanks to my extracurricular skills and experience acquisition, such couldn't be said for many of my classmates. I am building GCAD Tech Academy to reduce the skill gap and increase the employability rate. Because my educational journey highlighted a critical gap between theoretical knowledge and practical industry applications. Despite my degree, I had to seek additional training in design software outside of school, only to realize I still lacked an in-depth understanding of design philosophy, workflows, usability, manufacturability, and customer experience design required in design engineering. To bridge this gap, I immersed myself in extensive reading, connected with senior industry professionals, and learned through my own mistakes and many internships.

This inspired me to create GCAD Tech, an eLearning platform designed to equip engineering graduates with the practical skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the industry, effectively closing the skill gap and preparing them for real-world demands. Tens of thousands of engineering graduates enter the job market in Nigeria every year, but a significant number struggle to find employment due to a substantial skill gap between university education and industry requirements. With over 12 years of experience in design engineering, product design, and development, and 13 years in training delivery, I am passionate about bridging this gap and empowering graduates with the skills they need to be the ready workforce.",Generative CAD Services Limited,Nigeria,felix.amaefule@generativecad.com,www.generativecad.com,7036689810,Yes,"EMEA, Africa",https://www.linkedin.com/company/generative-cad-services/,@generativecad,@generativecad ,@generativecad ,Education,"Learn, Network, Connect, Access, Grow.

For the last 9 years, I have been a resilience consultant, solving multi year, multi-million dollar resilience problems for clients like GS, Wise & Amazon. Now I am using this experience to assist investors and entrepreneurs to build operationally viable companies.  

I like to explain resilience with a recipe analogy. Building a successful entrepreneur, startup, or choosing the right investment, can feel like making pancakes without a recipe. You have all the ingredients, but no clear instructions. This leads to inconsistency, missed opportunities, and often, failure.

My focus is to take the guesswork out of scaling operationally viable companies. I do this in the form of masterclasses, boot camps and with Mangrove software. 

For scaleups: We build a digital replica of your scaleup, focused on building your operations around your user journey. We then provide analysis on key indicators of failure. This means having a concise recipe that can enable data-driven decisions.

For VCs: We provide a transparency lifeline into your portfolio's operational health to proactively minimize risk and maximize ROI.

As the founder of Insectflux, I’ve spent years researching and building solutions to address food waste and sustainability.

I’ve conducted 390+ industry interviews and built a waitlist of 630+ global players, including farmers, insect farms, and institutions like the UN and USDA.

Unique Perspective:

I bring a global perspective grounded in local action. Based in Silicon Valley and backed by Jason Calacanis’ incubator-accelerator, I’ve seen firsthand how technology can drive scalable, sustainable solutions.

My background in politics and economics allows me to connect the dots between policy, innovation, and real-world impact.

Storytelling Ability:

I’ll share personal stories from farmers, insect farms, and innovators who are transforming the food system, making the talk relatable and inspiring.

I’ll combine data-driven insights with emotional narratives to engage the audience on both intellectual and emotional levels.

Commitment to the Process:

I’m excited to work with TEDxUCLA’s speaker coaches to refine my talk and maximize its impact.

I’ll dedicate 1-2 hours per week to developing and rehearsing my talk, ensuring it’s polished and impactful.

Alignment with TEDx Values:

The talk embodies curiosity, imagination, inclusion, and impact, aligning perfectly with TED’s curation guidelines.

I’m passionate about sharing this idea not to promote a product, but to inspire change and foster a more sustainable future.
