Steps
1. Export Chat from WhatsApp
- Export the chat without media to .txt format.

2. Preprocessing
- Replace characters like commas (,), dashes (-), and colons (:) with semi-colons (;) to standardize splitting.

- N.B This step is handled in your pre-cleaned .txt file, or automated in Python.

3. Load and Parse Data in Python
- Read the .txt files using Python.

- Split each line using ; as the delimiter.

- Extract relevant fields: Date, Hour, Minute, Sender, and Message.

4. Transform and Clean
- Merge Hour and Minute into a proper Time column.

- Convert Date and Time into datetime-compatible formats.

- Remove rows that are incomplete (nulls, system messages, etc.).

5. Add Metadata
- Add a new Group column to identify the source WhatsApp group (based on file name or label).

6. Sentiment Analysis
- Use TextBlob to calculate Polarity of each message.

- Classify messages as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

7. Merge All Files
- Loop through multiple .txt files and combine them into a single dataset with consistent structure.

8. Export Clean Dataset
- Save the final result as a single .xlsx file (e.g., All_WhatsApp_Groups_Combined.xlsx).

9. Visualize
- Create sentiment distribution, top senders, and activity trend charts.

- Save plots automatically to an Images/ folder.
