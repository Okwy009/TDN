17/10/2024; 09;18 ; Jesus Is Lord; GM GM Core team

We have some specific tasks; for some specific persons) to do this week 

We have started already and we aim to complete it before Saturday 


So; @2347039864935 and @2348136509806 ; we are working together on this one


Our tasks now are;

1. Get the form ready 
2. Send it to every community member to fill via an outreach message
3. Get them to follow the community's socials and yours likewise 
4. After the forms; follow up for them to engage 

While Mimi is working on the forms; Dawn is going to help us compose an outreach message that will include the form; to be sent to every member of the community for them to fill 


_(the form is about getting to know the categories of our members as to know what skills they have; opportunities that they can benefit and resources they might need)_


So instead of asking randomly; who can do this or that; we already know who to meet


The form is supposed to be ready today; 

While it's being finalised; Dawn; you can start working on the outreach message 


So that when it's done; we can start shipping it out
17/10/2024; 09;18 ; Jesus Is Lord; If there are any questions; you can ask here or in my DM
17/10/2024; 09;19 ; Jesus Is Lord; Then for the product team

(That should be @2348066024018 ;)

 based on our last meeting; we are expecting a product design by weekend 

Right?

We'll be reviewing content; having conversations about tasks etc here. 

Moving forward.

For starters would like to know where we're at at content creation/distribution.

If theres still some dilly;dallying; I suggest you start repurposing all the ```relevant``` content on the announcement channel.


For example I just made a post about the #web3phc event coming up. 

And some other revents like borderless. 

These should be cross posted across all our socials. 

I posted on IG and that automatically posts to FB. 


So; I'd like a Twitter & LinkedIn post made as well using the right hashtags etc.

If you need more info reach out to me or @2349093213098 🙏🏽 

Also our event posts and photos need to be repurposed as content and posted across all our socials. 

These are the everyday posts on X; IG; Li & FB posts before even the blog posts tor Medium
23/10/2024; 21;14 ; Violet Benson; Hey Squad!

Honestly; silent observers make me uneasy. So; let's shake things up. It's time for a housekeeping refresh.. and y'all know I love to keep things minimalistic.

So; I'm going to fire up a poll and I'd like your active responses. 

Please confirm if you have the availability to move forward with this core team.

If timing isn't right; don't worry! I'll create a pioneers Lounge where you can relax and recharge. 

When the stars align; we'll reconnect with exclusive perks for our loyal pioneers who've been with us for soo long.

For now; we need to streamline our workflow and silence doesn't work well with me. You can still contribute on the main channels but we'd like to keep things active in here and that means a vibrant interactive and contributing group.  

Thanks for understanding! 🙏🏽 

Cheers; 
 _Violet_

OPTION; Taking a break rn; might come back later. 🤔 (3 votes)

23/10/2024; 21;21 ; +234 706 497 4370; Hi Violet;

I have followed up in the community for a while now and I love the product prototype released recently.

I would love to explore being a core contributor from January.

I'm still have one or two things to sort with my health and family responsibilities.

I would have opted to be assigned things to do like content writing or where a calendar is available; I can pick a couple of content to write if that works.

I just thought to drop a message for context on my vote
23/10/2024; 21;24 ; Violet Benson; Wishing you healthy and your family all the support you need at this time. 💕 

However; I'm not clear on what you deciding. 


It's perfectly okay to come back in January. If you'd like to contribute now; we have the support of @2347039864935 and @2348136509806 who are working on the content calendar for the socials. 

Any which way; there's always a spot for you.. 

And especially to all our active core contributor's from Day 1. 

Your roles have been beyond just your skills; you've been the motivation and soul keeping the community alive like a candle on the patio. 

And for that; there'll always be a special spot for you and I mean this literally.

24/10/2024; 11;57 ; Violet Benson; Expand on it. You can ask the help of AI to expand on it so that it gives more context. 

For example a prompt like; 

Create a post out of this for Linkedin; Facebook; Twitter and Instagram with relevant hashtags. 

And then you edit to fit the right "tone" that doesn't sound too mechanical. 

Also IG doesn't support links so they won't be able to click. 

So things like send a DM for the link would be better for IG.

But the rest of the channels support links.

Goodluck ✨

24/10/2024; 12;25 ; Violet Benson; Please keep voting. It'll only take a few seconds.

But it's important we do this. 

We need a vibrant space where we're actively contributing and that might be sullied by passiveness. 

Which is why I created this lounge @120363332879105167@g.us because I very much intend to recognise the people who've been here the longest when the time comes for that. 

That way; you're not forgotten and we're held accountable to you. 

So please join that group if you're a pioneer contributor who can no longer afford to continue because of one reason or another. 🙏🏽
24/10/2024; 12;27 ; Violet Benson; As for the ones voting to stay!!✨✨

*Overcoming Imposter Syndrome; A DAO Network Community Discussion*

Feeling like a fraud? You're not alone. Imposter syndrome affects many of us in the DAO Network; leaving us wondering if we're truly good enough.

*Breaking the Silence*

It's time to shatter the stigma surrounding imposter syndrome. Let's share our experiences; empower each other; and build a supportive community.

*Three Ways to Overcome Imposter Syndrome*

1. *Own Your Expertise*

28/10/2024; 18;12 ; +1 (416) 858;5004; Are you doing the white paper first or the deck? Just out of the curiosity
28/10/2024; 18;13 ; +1 (416) 858;5004; I imagine that the deck is being done. The white paper is already done
28/10/2024; 18;13 ; Violet Benson; The deck first
28/10/2024; 18;13 ; +1 (416) 858;5004; So you're going right to Corey search and core figures and elements for that deck
28/10/2024; 18;13 ; +1 (416) 858;5004; Core*
28/10/2024; 18;13 ; Violet Benson; No the white paper isn't done yet. Tbh; we wanted to focus on web2.5 VCs first which was why priority was given to the deck.
28/10/2024; 18;13 ; +1 (416) 858;5004; Okay
28/10/2024; 18;14 ; Violet Benson; But with this new development. Both can happen at the same time.
28/10/2024; 18;14 ; +1 (416) 858;5004; True

Welcome chief!
30/10/2024; 17;49 ; Violet Benson; Please let's be active. 


Told you guys I wnated us going heavy on marketing so we don't suffer from success. 

We just got our first $20;000 project and barely no one to handle it. 

😭
30/10/2024; 17;50 ; Violet Benson; Congrats to us btw. But without anyone to fill it up; we might lose this contract.
30/10/2024; 17;50 ; Jesus Is Lord; Which job request ma?
30/10/2024; 17;51 ; Violet Benson; The book.
30/10/2024; 17;51 ; Violet Benson; They're offering us $20k to do it.
30/10/2024; 17;52 ; Violet Benson; Don't share the exact amount on the group. I don't want unqualified people to bombard us because of the fee.
30/10/2024; 17;52 ; Jesus Is Lord; Okay boss
30/10/2024; 17;54 ; Ejiro Nice DAO; Which book ma
30/10/2024; 17;55 ; Violet Benson; Not in your scope.

@2349093213098 knows what I'm referring to.
30/10/2024; 17;56 ; Violet Benson; But yeah we should make a post to celebrate this milestone. 

I wanted us to do that AFTER we do get the job but so far; getting the right talents is proving a bit difficult. 

And people work with time here. 

I keep saying that speed is money. 

20% of $20;000 might be small but it is far bigger than what we thought we'd achieve when I said I wanted to monetise before the end of the year.
30/10/2024; 17;57 ; Jesus Is Lord; I've sent the message to my twitter; status and communities too

Let's see if we can get someone from there

Navigating the job market can be challenging; but with the right strategies; you can stand out and land your ideal role. In this guide; we’ll walk you through essential job search tips to help you present your skills; connect with employers; and make a lasting impression. Let’s get you set up for success! 


*1. Make Your Skills Stand Out*
Your skills are what will set you apart; so make sure they're front and center. Highlight what you’re best at and how you’ve added value in previous roles. Be specific – numbers and results speak louder than words.

*2. Tailor Every Application*  
Each role is unique; and so should be your application. Take the time to tailor your resume and cover letter for each job; addressing specific skills and experiences that match the job description. Show employers you’re the perfect fit!

*3. Leverage Your Network*
Don't underestimate the power of networking. Reach out to former colleagues; attend industry events; and connect with professionals on LinkedIn. Often; the best opportunities come from who you know.

*4. Research the Company*  
Show employers that you’re genuinely interested in their mission and values. Study the company’s culture; recent projects; and goals; and let that knowledge shine in your application and interview responses.
 *5. Follow Up Thoughtfully* 
After applying or interviewing; follow up with a polite message to show your continued interest. This small step can make a big impression and keep you fresh in the recruiter’s mind.

One more thing; you can start tagging brands that are related to the content. 

For example; if we're talking about where to buy crypto. The caption can be;

“So; the only thing stopping you from coming Onchain is finding a reliable crypto merchant? Wow. When there's @Binance or @MetaMask or @Trustwallet at your perusal?... Etc”

That way; we're leveraging their name and audience to train the algorithm.

My name is Divine; I’m a UI/UX Designer and I’ve been seeking for an intern or junior role where I can learn from other Designers and gain actual work experience. If your budget does not allow for new hire; I’m willing to work for free my only goal is to gain really world experience 
I am a hard worker and I promise you will smile at this decision

We can drop ideas relative to our product designs and landing page over here for discussions and collaborations
06/11/2024; 10;11 ; Violet Benson; Ask the main community if anyone is interested in joining us here to build. 

But before that; ensure that everyone here has a role and actively doing something weekly. 

Else please remove. 

We share a lot of info here; I don't want to info dump on static contributors and I also want everyone to be accountable weekly. 

Said that earlier when we migrated the others to the @120363332879105167@g.us

We are expecting the template of the product design from the product team @2348066024018 and his team 

We are expecting a simple landing page from @2349079254873 

We are expecting video contents from the border less events from @2347069504561

We are currently in the Battledogs Contest with a few community members 

We are still scouting job opportunities for our members

Two virtual assistants sent in a form for freelance work but they haven't replied and it's past the deadline already <This message was edited>
15/11/2024; 13;34 ; Violet Benson; Silent moves. Cool cool
15/11/2024; 13;34 ; Violet Benson; I'll reach out to the VAs and find out what's up?
15/11/2024; 13;36 ; Violet Benson; I did some organizing as well. 

Noticed someone sent in multiple documents about their product; so I just put it in a folder. 

But I found that he root cause was the method of info uploading. 

So; could we add the option of a link on the product upload section?

That way they can organize multiple documents in a folder and send us the link instead. 

We have to put a disclaimer in red though; that they need to ensure that the link is accessible.
15/11/2024; 13;38 ; Jesus Is Lord; Ok
@2347039864935 will look into it asap

20/11/2024; 12;39 ; Jesus Is Lord; It's our duty to follow our social media accounts and engage on each post made

You can even turn on notifications so that anytime a post is made; you can see it and comment; and like them

That's a way of contributing as a core team because it's "our project" 


If we are having 15+ likes and comments on our posts; it's encouraging and sends a signal that of course; there are people that follow and believe in the project 


We might be occupied with some things...yes...but a particular period of time each day can be separated to cover all that 


Also; our Growth Session is more or less like a meeting to get updates about the project and the direction we are heading to


It's also mandatory for every team member to be present as well; that's how we know what to do for the week and areas we can contribute as well


Let's all work together for the success of the project by showing it through our activeness and engagements 


Thanks! <This message was edited>

21/11/2024; 11;58 ; Dawn; *Negotiate Your Worth; 6 Essential Tips*

When it comes to salary negotiation; confidence and preparation are key. Here's how to *own the conversation* and get the compensation you deserve;

To start; *know your market value*. Research industry standards using online resources like Glassdoor or Payscale. This will give you a solid foundation for your negotiation.

Next; *highlight your strengths*. Make a list of your skills; qualifications; and achievements. Emphasize your unique strengths and how they benefit the company.

*Set a target salary range* based on your research and skills. Be realistic; but aim high.

Then; *master the anchor technique*. When the employer presents the offer; say;

"Thank you for sharing the offer. Based on my research; I was expecting a range of $X to $Y; considering industry standards and my skills. Would there be room for discussion to meet somewhere in the middle?"

*Be flexible* and consider the whole package; including benefits; bonuses; and perks. Don't bring up personal financial issues; focus on your professional value.

Lastly; *don't be afraid to walk away* if the offer isn't right. You deserve fair compensation for your skills and experience.

*Negotiate with confidence* and own your worth!

_Sarah's Story_

I'm still shaking my head; thinking about that crazy job I had. I thought it was legit. Customer service rep; helping people. But little did I know; the company was scamming people! They'd take their info; steal their money. I was the face of the company; handling calls and emails; and I had no clue. One client called; saying someone stole their identity; and that's when it hit me – I was working for crooks! I quit ASAP.

_Buki's Story_

Honestly; I'm still trying to process the whole ordeal. I was so excited to land that job; thinking it was my big break. But the pay was laughable – $50 a month! And the work? Exhausting. Hundreds of calls daily; no benefits; no support. It was exploitation; plain and simple. I felt like a robot; not a human being. When I realized I was being taken advantage of; I knew I had to leave.

_Mumbi's Story_

Oh; dear Lord... I'm still reeling from that virtual assistant job. Thought it was a flexible opportunity; but nope! They took advantage of my good nature. Completed tasks; sent invoices... crickets. No payment; no communication. Left me feeling defeated; wondering what I did wrong. But I learned a valuable lesson; research; research; research! Don't trust everyone with a fancy website.

08/12/2024; 10;46 ; Violet Benson; Hey Social Media Team;

I wanted to discuss our social media presence at events. Yesterday; I was disappointed to see that not a single post went up apart from the one I had to rush to post.

As you know; our social media presence is crucial for our brand's visibility and engagement. When we're at events; it's essential that we're actively posting updates; photos; and behind;the;scenes content.

Going forward; I'd like for anyone in charge of the handles to be in charge of posting live updates from events. This will help us stay on top of our social media game and ensure that our audience is engaged.

Let's discuss this further and come up with a plan to improve our social media presence at events.

Thanks!

20/12/2024; 10;55 ; Kenechukwu CEO; Hi team! 🌟  

Have you heard about the Chinese bamboo tree? 

When it’s planted; nothing happens for five whole years—it doesn’t even sprout. 

But during that time; it’s growing deep roots underground.

And then; in the fifth year; it suddenly shoots up over 80 feet tall in just a few weeks!  

I feel like what You all are building here is just like that bamboo tree. 

You’re putting in the hard work; growing strong roots; and preparing for something incredible. It might not always feel like You’re moving fast; but trust me—Your breakthrough is coming; and it’s going to be worth it. 

keep going! 💪✨

We've grown our team with talented individuals who share our passion for tech and community;building. They've brought new skills and perspectives; and it's been amazing to see how they've contributed to our growth.

We've also had an incredible year of events! We attended Techpro; Borderless; Web3PH; and SS9; connecting with industry leaders; learning about the latest trends; and showcasing our community's talents.

But that's not all! We've provided hundreds of job opportunities to our community members; and collaborated with amazing partners like Web3PH; Battle Dogs NFT; and Borderless. We've also created a prototype of our landing page; designed to showcase our community's spirit and values.

Lastly; we've added a bot to our community to ensure a safe and secure environment for our members; and improved our social media presence to expand our online reach.

Thanks to everyone who's been part of our journey this year! We couldn't have done it without you. Here's to an amazing 2025!

I hope this message finds you refreshed; revitalized; and ready to tackle this new year with enthusiasm. If it doesn't; shake your head 3X and you'll get back some energy. (Fr)

As we dive into 2025; it seems like it's been 300 days already but it's just been 17; and I want you to know how grateful I am to have each and every one of you on this journey with us. I mean; in the end; you'll be thanking me back 😂 but still. 

I've been quietly working behind the scenes; thinking; contemplating; creating; visualizing; subtracting; recreating; etc; making moves that will propel us forward in incredible ways. 

And I'm excited to share our plan for the year with you—so that we're all on the same page and can see how feasibly our lives are about to change in 2025😫. 

 *Our Plan for the Year* 

 _To achieve a minimum of;_ 

; 50 clients
; $10;000 per client per year for talents (minimum investment)
; $500;000 Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
; $100;000 for the core team (20% of ARR)

 *Double;Minimum Target;* 

; 100+ clients
; $1;000;000 ARR
; $200;000 for the core team 

 *Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)* 
; 300 outreach per month
; 2;3% retention rate; aiming for 6 clients per month

 *WORKTABLE/ TO;DO LIST* 

 *1. _Lead Generation and Outreach_* 
    ; Week 1; Identify 300 potential clients and engage with their content (I've been subtly doing that already but we need to document and get a couple more hands on deck)
    ; Week 1;3; Comment on their posts daily for 7 days
    ; Week 4; Send warm DMs or emails introducing our unique offer (Doing that already)

    _; Roles needed;_ Lead generation person; Outreach person (ideally me); Follow;up person (me and the sheet tracking manager)

 *2. _Pitch Deck Design_* 
    ; Create a compelling pitch deck for outreach messages (Content + Design team)

 *3. _Profile Page and Branding_* 
    ; Update profile page to promote our brand and services uniquely.
    ; Develop a brand catalogue showcasing client acquisition and job employment progress

 *4. _Micro Investments and YouTube Channel_* 
    ; Unlock micro investments aspect of the brand by creating UT content and posting (Already making arrangements for UGC corner with our Video team. Need media team to come up with abstract videos as well) 
    ; Activate and utilize YouTube channel (already done)
    ; Create thumbnails for videos (Design team)

 *5. _Website Content and Contracts_* 
    ; Write and publish content for our website
    ; Address tasks from newly created contracts (Some OG core contributors received their shiny contracts at the start of the year; these ones have shown that they're not going anywhere anytime soon 😭 and have been consistently pouring into the idea. The next batch of contracts will be rolled out over the next 3;6 months)

 *6. _Social Media Strategy_* 
    ; Develop a simple social media strategy (leave comprehensive for now 😂)
    ; Identify and leverage relevant hashtags (Really Really important. Been playing with Tiktok on this and realized hashtags and design and  music marketing go a long way.
    ; Share engaging content and behind;the;scenes insights (What are our product developers; founders and brands designing? Outreach team reaches out; gets content for them and shares with content and media team for a very short documentary) Bonus content for YouTube. 

 *7. _Client Relationship Management_* 
    ; Implement a CRM system to track client interactions (Notion; hello?)
    ; Develop a client onboarding process (Me 😫)
    ; Establish regular check;ins and feedback loops (This year; I want you all in my ears all the time and vice versa. We're all in a relationship with each other. Idc)

 *8. _Team Development and Training_* 
    ; Identify training needs for team members (Ngl; design team is where I'm looking at first. Using a mic of AI / Copy paste from tutorials and other creators content to start understanding the design concepts until we build our own brand. Bonus point; a standard portfolio for the people reaching out. Because I can not in good conscience recommend a talent that I myself would never hire. I have to be honest; I'm sorry. 😫
    ; Develop a training plan and schedule (Once a week or bi;monthly until y'all decide otherwise)
    ; Foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement (By organizing webinars and workshops where senior leaders come to teach others about these things. 

9. *_Performance Monitoring and Evaluation_* 
    ; Establish key metrics for performance evaluation (Hence the use of several tools as opposed to traditional tracking)
    ; Regularly review and assess progress
    ; Make data;driven decisions to optimize strategies

 *Mandatory Tools for 2025* 
To ensure we're working efficiently and effectively; the following tools are mandatory for everyone;

; Notion (for project management; note;taking; and collaboration)
; Google Workspace (for email; document collaboration; and cloud storage)
; Google Meet (for virtual meetings and remote collaboration)
; WhatsApp (for team communication and real;time feedback)
; Tally (for form creation and management)

Trust me; you'll thank me profusely later for making these tools a part of our workflow! Especially Notion. It's the hottest thing in the market rn and if you're not using it; you might not pass the vetting process for some of these big brands. Depending on several factors of course; but is that a risk you're willing to make?

 *Important; Mandatory Meeting Tonight!*  ⚠️ 
Don't forget that we have a mandatory meeting tonight at 6 pm on Google Meet. 

Attendance is compulsory for everyone; as we'll be discussing our plan and strategies for the year. If you haven't received the meeting link yet; please reach out to @2349093213098 ASAP.


Remember; I'm always here to support and guide. If you have any questions or need clarification on anything; please don't hesitate to reach out. I might be making silent moves; but my door is always open!

We've got this; I'm positive of it! <This message was edited>

16/02/2025; 13;31 ; Violet Benson; @2347069719374 is the cyborg designing our AI infrastructure and holding everybody's hands as we integrate with innovative tech.

While I'm now realizing that they're both namesakes; please let's leave @2347069719374 to continue being the _Schwiz_ I've none for over a decade 😂

And @2349079254873 to be the only _Solomon_ that comes to mind when I hear that name.

16/02/2025; 17;18 ; Violet Benson; So apparently; @2349093213098 has been mistaken you both and convinced your name was Solomon. 

If I hadn't known you for this long; I'd have believed. In fact; I did. Then I wondered why you had two English names and only used this one? And why you've never ever used your other name. And then it hit me like a moving train. 😫

I'm sitting here thinking about how far we've come; and I'm blown away. Some of you are still not aligned with how far we've come but all will be revealed soon. 

Your hard work; creativity; and dedication have taken us to heights I never thought possible.

Now; I want to ask you something. 

What if I told you that the next 5;10 years are going to be even bigger?

That we're on the cusp of something incredible in the whole continent?

The question is; how do we make our brand stand out and stay relevant in a world that's changing faster than ever?

I don't have all the answers. But I do know that I'm surrounded by some of the most talented; driven people on the planet.

So; here's the challenge; what would you do if you knew you couldn't fail? Would you take risks? Push boundaries? Challenge the status quo?

Well; I've seen the future and no matter how bleary it looked;  the vision is 8K sharp!!!

We can make the impossible possible.

Just wanted to show appreciation tonight because I'm just short of words; looking at all we've done so far. 

The excitement is just beginning.

24/02/2025; 20;30 ; Violet Benson; 90% of startups don’t fail because of;
Bad marketing; a weak team; or even a poor product. They fail because they lack a repeatable decision;making process.

Here’s the framework I use to make better; faster decisions in business. I call it “The Iteration Loop.” It’s a structured way to identify what’s working; what’s broken; and what to do next; without getting stuck in endless guesswork. It gives you a systematic way to eliminate bottlenecks; optimize execution; and scale with clarity.

Here are the 6 phases;
1. Bottleneck Identification
2. Clarifying the Goal 
3. Solution Brainstorming
4. Focused Execution
5. Performance Review
6. Iterate & Improve

1️⃣ Bottleneck Identification
Before you can fix anything; you need to identify the real problem.
Most entrepreneurs spin their wheels solving the wrong issues because they never dig deep enough. To get clarity; ask;
+ What's the biggest constraint stopping growth right now?
+ What metric; if doubled; would create the biggest impact?
+ What’s preventing us from getting there?
If you don’t identify the root problem; every solution you apply will be wasted effort.

2️⃣ Clarifying the Goal
Once you know the problem; define the exact outcome you’re solving for.
I use a simple Three;Part Goal Formula;
1. What are we trying to achieve?
2. By when?
3. What constraints do we have?
Vague goals lead to vague actions. Precision forces progress.

3️⃣ Solution Brainstorming
Now; generate every possible solution—without filtering. Most people limit themselves to their existing knowledge; which is why they get stuck. Instead; ask; “If there were no rules; what would I do?” This opens up better; faster; and often simpler solutions you wouldn’t have otherwise considered.

4️⃣ Focused Execution
Don’t test everything at once—test one variable at a time. Most teams waste months by making too many changes at once; leading to messy; inconclusive results. Instead; break it down;
1. Test one key assumption.
2. Measure one KPI that proves or disproves it.
3. Execute for a set period; then review.
4. Speed matters. Complexity kills momentum.

5️⃣ Performance Review
Your data isn’t just numbers—it’s feedback on your decision;making process.
Your job is to analyze;
+ Did the solution work?
+ Why or why not?
+ What does this tell us about our business? 
Every test refines your ability to make better future decisions.

6️⃣ Iterate & Improve
Most companies don’t fail from making the wrong move—they fail from making no moves at all. The only way to win long;term is to keep iterating. Instead of fearing failure; build a culture that rewards learning. Failure + Reflection = Progress. If you aren’t improving your decision;making process; your business will eventually hit a ceiling. That’s why I built The Iteration Loop—so every problem becomes an opportunity for better; faster execution.

28/02/2025; 19;57 ; Violet Benson; We already finished since
01/03/2025; 14;53 ; Violet Benson; Here are some title ideas that convey exclusivity in a more subtle way;

1. *"The AI Gathering"* (implies a curated; invite;only event)
2. *"Founders & AI; A Private Conversation"* (suggests an intimate; closed;door discussion)
3. *"The AI Salon"* (evokes a sense of a private; intellectual gathering)
4. *"Startup Founders' AI Briefing"* (implies a high;level; insider update)
5. *"The AI Roundtable"* (suggests a private; invitation;only discussion among peers)
6. *"AI for the Bold"* (implies an exclusive event for innovative; forward;thinking founders)
7. *"The AI Inner Workings"* (suggests a behind;the;scenes; insider look at AI)
8. *"Founders' AI Masterclass"* (implies an exclusive; high;level learning experience)

These titles aim to convey exclusivity and high;level access without being too obvious or over;the;top. Let me know if you'd like more ideas!
01/03/2025; 14;54 ; Violet Benson; For the Founders Live event; which topic do you guys think will be more appealing?

Email notifications with the scheduled timings have been sent to each of you.

Best regards

04/03/2025; 17;59 ; Violet Benson; Team;

As we continue to work towards our project goals; I wanted to take a moment to address some key issues that have been impacting our progress.

Firstly; despite verbal commitments; some team members have not been following due protocols or contributing efficiently. This lack of accountability and follow;through has resulted in delays and inefficiencies.

Additionally; some team members have not been showing up to scheduled meetings; which is essential for effective communication and collaboration.

Our Standards of Procedure (SoPs) are in place to ensure we're working efficiently and effectively. However; I've noticed that some team members are treating our SoPs as burdensome rather than recognizing their value as a time management system.

I want to emphasize that our SoPs are designed to help us achieve our goals; and I'm open to hearing suggestions for better systems that work for you. If you have alternative solutions that can improve our efficiency and effectiveness; please share them with the team.

However; if you're not willing to adapt to our current SoPs or suggest alternatives; then I expect you to follow the existing protocols. This is essential for maintaining consistency and ensuring we're all working towards the same objectives.

As we move forward; I expect all team members to;

; Follow due protocols and contribute efficiently
; Attend scheduled meetings and communicate effectively
; Adhere to our SoPs or suggest alternative solutions

For those who are not aligned with our goals or are unable to meet these expectations; I recommend staying in the announcement group if you wish to remain informed about our progress as spectators.

Please note that you have until the end of this week to consider your commitment to the project. After that; unaligned members will be removed from the group.

Due to the size of the group; I won't be able to check in individually with each of you. If you have specific questions or concerns; please reach out to me directly or contact our community admin; @2349093213098  who is responsible for ensuring our systems run smoothly.

I want to emphasize that I value each and every one of you; and I'd hate to see some of you leave. However; I must prioritize the progress of this project especially now more than ever; over any personal sentiments. 

So; if @2349093213098 removes any one of you at the end of the week; know that I sanctioned it. 

Let's work together to achieve our goals.

Best; Violet. 💕

10/03/2025; 11;20 ; Jesus Is Lord; Good morning; team.

Trust you are doing well today.

As we continue to work together towards our shared objectives; we would like to provide a brief update on our communication strategy.


To ensure that everyone is informed and aligned; we will be transitioning from individual calls with Ms. Violet to weekly group calls.

This will enable us to discuss tasks; share updates; and address any questions or concerns in a collaborative setting.


In preparation for these group calls; we will be reaching out to each group (Graphics; Content; AI & Security; Product; and Video) to schedule a time slot that works for everyone. 

This will ensure that all team members can participate and contribute to the discussions.


Additionally; please note that our growth sessions will now be held in X space; replacing Google Meet. 

We encourage everyone to join and support this initiative.


We will also be scheduling a general team meeting in the near future. 

Details regarding the date; time; and agenda will be shared separately.

Thank you for your cooperation and commitment to our team's success. 

We wish you all a productive day ahead.

How are we doing? I’d be running a quick recap of our activities to keep the group updated.

@96623963193484 and his team are current working on the pitch deck.

@5338761805968 has completed the dashboards for talents and clients; he’s making progress on the Founder’s dashboard. 

For the event happening on the 3rd of may; which is 11 days from now; @145136105304271 would help post and promote contents on the talent fair and give details on some of the activities to be held at the event. 

If there’s something new coming onboard; I’d notify the group.

You can either drop a reaction or say something to show that this message has been acknowledged.
