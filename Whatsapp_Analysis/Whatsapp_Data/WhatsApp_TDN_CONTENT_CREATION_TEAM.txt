28/02/2025; 07;35 ; Success DAO; These are themes.

Good morning everyone.
28/02/2025; 07;36 ; Success DAO; Is this what is needed?
28/02/2025; 07;45 ; Jesus Is Lord; A bit but not this
28/02/2025; 07;45 ; Jesus Is Lord; Kindly go through this message 
And the messages sent to the core team for more information 

Thank you
28/02/2025; 07;46 ; Success DAO; What do we need?
28/02/2025; 07;52 ; Success DAO; I still don't get it. I have gone through the messages.

I am asking about the themes.
Does the theme align?
28/02/2025; 07;55 ; Jesus Is Lord; Okay

We don't just need a theme

We need a well written event description that would compel people to join the event 

Alongside with other details that have been included in the task

So when you have gotten your theme

Write a compelling description for the event with a good call to action 

(You can write more than one for different themes then we get to choose which is better)

This is what we need

Hope you understand it ma'am?
28/02/2025; 08;08 ; Success DAO; No offense sir but I thought we were supposed to get the themes first before writing the copy?

Your explanation is the same way I understood it; I just took it one at a time... Themes first; then compelling copy next.

So my question is on the theme; sir kindly; can you pick the themes I am writing on?

Like can you vet the themes and tell me the ones that resonate with what you want done? The ones I am writing on. <This message was edited>
28/02/2025; 08;24 ; Jesus Is Lord; Ok then 

Let's wait for @2349057895997

18/03/2025; 08;53 ; Jesus Is Lord; Good morning team 
How are we doing today 

We have something to do research about 

We want to create content doing a review about the activities that has happened in the community this month

Titled

"BTS at the Network this Month"

So dear honourable content team;

How do we go about this?

First we have to list out activities that have happened and will still happen this month 

Secondly; we need to get the written plan for it; the write up of how we are going to set the kini

_(if you know what I mean üòèü§≠)_


Thirdly; we decide if it's going to be a video content or a graphics carousel flyer design 

But then again; no need "to reinvent the wheel"

We can do research on how it is done in the social media space and everyone will drop their findings in the next few hours so that we can start working towards it 


Are we on the same page?
18/03/2025; 09;06 ; Jesus Is Lord; <Media omitted>
18/03/2025; 09;06 ; Violet Benson; I think starting with a carousel will be easier. Since we have that locked down.
18/03/2025; 09;07 ; Jesus Is Lord; Then we also need to start a campaign message on our social media platforms to get more Devs to represent the community for this event
18/03/2025; 09;08 ; Jesus Is Lord; Alright ma 
That would be nice 

So next is the contents; then we ship it to the graphics team for the final output
18/03/2025; 09;11 ; Violet Benson; This can be done everywhere and anywhere. 

Final call. 

Mention how we have one team and just looking for another. 

Alternatively; we can post on RSU; Uniport and IAUOE FB student groups
18/03/2025; 09;13 ; Jesus Is Lord; Okkk

Alright

To schedule our weekly group call;

Is there information or a current project I can catch up with .

13/05/2025; 09;52 ; Decentra; Good morning house 
How are we today?

Have we gone through the document? If yes; let‚Äôs work on the delegated tasks. Also; I advice that we use this period to familiarize ourselves with Notion. 

The notion account has been created and is being set up as we speak; once it‚Äôs ready; it would be introduced both here and on the core group. 

Only one person responded to the poll. That‚Äôs a poor start; we can do better.

Good morning again. Do have a great dayüß° <This message was edited>
