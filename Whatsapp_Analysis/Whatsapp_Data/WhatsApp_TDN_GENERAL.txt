Bootstrapping a business or landing the next role can be tough when you're the product.

The biggest hurdle is overcoming our own internal biases. The big question is how to spot and overcome these biases.

Hiya DAOists!

Survived the weekend? Great! 

Now; let's tackle Q4 (and our existential dread about meeting those year;end goals).

Help us understand your interests and availability. 

Take a few minutes to complete this survey;

(https;//forms.gle/uFnkgwEDg8m8VyyQ9)

We'll use your input to;

1. Match you with exclusive opportunities
2. Personalize our programs
3. Enhance community engagement
4. Assign exclusive membership cards and community census number

Thanks for not ghosting us! üëª 

Cheers to a productive Q4!

Best;

18/11/2024; 13;14 ; Violet Benson; This is why I use a sweat equity vesting schedule. üò¢ 

You can consider introduce a standardized sweat equity policy across the organization; tying equity vesting to performance and contribution. This would enable the board to claw back equity from non;performing/underperforming stakeholders; including the ex;advisor. 

By getting all stakeholders to sign off on this policy; you'll create a unified agreement that promotes accountability; fairness; and transparency moving forward. 

Hope this helps. 

If you need a template of this; I can make you a copy of the schedule I use across my organizations. 

Goodluck. ‚ú®
18/11/2024; 13;14 ; Violet Benson; I forgot I was going to discuss this and just moved on to my to;do list. 

ü•≤
18/11/2024; 13;33 ; +234 806 750 5876; I think in this situation; you need to review the agreement under which the stock was issued.
Check if they are conditions to reclaim the stock if the advisor did not meet his obligation to the company.

Another strategy is to dilute the stock by raising new rounds and issuing new shares to investors and employees. This will dilute all stocks
18/11/2024; 13;38 ; Violet Benson; I'm wary of the suggested strategies for resolving the issue with the ex;advisor. 

Reviewing the initial stock agreement may lead to costly litigation and time;consuming negotiations. 

On the other hand; implementing a dilution strategy through additional funding rounds can result in ownership dilution; decreased valuation; which can lower morale among investors and employees. All for one person's incompetence?

Moreover; it may introduce new complexities to the company dynamics.

Other crucial factors come to mind; tax implications; regulatory compliance; potential impact on future funding rounds; and reputational consequences ; all potential landmines waiting to be triggered.
18/11/2024; 13;41 ; +234 806 750 5876; Nice observation.
So; what do you advice in this situation.
They are sure to be careful in future dealings; but how will they resolve this particular issue?
18/11/2024; 13;45 ; Violet Benson; Mostly like a different clause. But stating what happens when people underperform. Over a specified period. 


Based on what I observed; some people perform;bomb within the first couple months and then trickle back down to doing the bare minimum.

So; I recommend tying the clawback policy into the vesting schedule and even beyond. 

So even after the equity is matured; there can still be penalties based on their quarterly report.

Starts off with a mild reminder to sit back up. 

Then a pause on dividends; etc; then a reduction in equity. 

They have the option to earn it back if they put in more effort and results.

I feel stressed but I‚Äôve taken time to peel off the first layer of the exciting things that happened in the month of November. Next up is my experience at #GEF with Vusi Thembekwayo. 

You don‚Äôt want to miss the exciting things I learnt from his private session so set your notifications bells and enjoy.‚Ä®‚Ä®

The first layer; https;//x.com/behindtextdev/status/1865426780980731993

15/12/2024; 22;51 ; Violet Benson; Speaking of AI; I've noticed that many people aren't automating tasks enough and so life becomes increasingly ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù with so much to handle as a digital creator; etc. But it's mostly because they're not fluent in the tech stacks that have been designed to help make these things a lot easier in this jet age. 

Simply because they're biased; ignorant or don't trust in the ability of a supersonic processor; but would rely on traditional processors like our dear old brain. Or they haven't the time; patience or energy to setup; learn or start acquainting themselves with these tools.

23/12/2024; 08;36 ; Kenechukwu CEO; *Here's Why Criticizing AI Content Creation Might Be Missing the Point* 

AI tools like ChatGPT are not here to replace creativity‚Äîthey‚Äôre here to enhance it. 

Think of AI as a helpful assistant; much like a calculator for math or spellcheck for writing. 

It‚Äôs a tool that saves time; offers fresh ideas; and helps content creators focus on the bigger picture.  

Here‚Äôs the truth; *the value of content lies in its authenticity; relevance; and ability to connect with the audience* .

Whether it‚Äôs created by hand or with the help of AI; what matters most is how it resonates with people.  

AI content is shaped by the person using it. It‚Äôs the writer who decides the tone; edits the message; and ensures it fits the brand.

Without human creativity and judgment; AI is just a tool waiting for direction.  

Instead of seeing AI as a threat; why not view it as an opportunity? It helps small businesses compete; supports writers with tight deadlines; and makes content creation accessible to more people.  

What‚Äôs your Contribution? Do you think  AI tools like ChatGPT are here to help or harm creativity?

17/01/2025; 18;10 ; +234 806 051 4381; *Why should I learn online advertising?*

Tapping into the massive stream of customers online and being able to target your desired customers is every business's dream!

People and brands have moved online; so you need to take your business and marketing online.

It's not rocket science. You have to do it the right way or you will get no result.

*Can I earn with the skill?*

A beginner Ad manager charges about $50 per gig; you can multiply that by just 1 client in a day.

Tell me how you can be ever broke again. You can never lose on this one! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*But I am new to online advertising*

If you‚Äôre new to Facebook advertising; you‚Äôve struck gold.

You‚Äôll learn what has taken me countless hours (and money) to test so that you can begin advertising the right way the first time.

You will learn from all my mistakes and all the trial and errors that led me into discovering the secrets to running profitable advertising campaigns quickly and constantly.

*Can I learn it in a short time to start earning?*

Even a kid can learn the basics and principles of online advertising in a few days because you will watch me live as I break everything into tiny bits you can digest and in very simple language.

You can practice with me during the live class and ask me questions on the go.

19/01/2025; 18;31 ; Violet Benson; Hi everyone; urgent question here. Is there anyone who works in/with TikTok? Or maybe someone can advise on what to do?

Here‚Äôs the situation; some individuals have stolen a video of our product from our Instagram; which had around 18 million views there. They uploaded it to TikTok before us and are now engaging in fraud. They're selling our device; which hasn‚Äôt even been released to the market yet; through fake websites in the comments.

When we uploaded the video to TikTok; the platform claimed it wasn‚Äôt original and rejected our appeal; stating that we violated community guidelines. However; it‚Äôs clear from our content that the video is ours‚Äîit features our brand and matches the style of all our other posts. Meanwhile; their account is filled with unrelated content! TikTok also rejected our reports against those individuals.

We‚Äôve filed a copyright infringement claim; but it‚Äôs been under review for over 24 hours; and their views keep growing. People might be getting scammed.
What can we do? ü•≤
19/01/2025; 18;31 ; Violet Benson; Anyone know what to do in this case?
19/01/2025; 18;35 ; +234 813 195 7891; Everything is explanation.

The only issue is if the video don't have brand logo .

If it has and it is same with their profile picture ;it will be better.

Or better still they contact a tiktok influencer in diaspora to flag it from his end with assist of other influencers in diaspora.

It will be a team fight

07/02/2025; 13;11 ; Violet Benson; Yes; was thinking of adding that to m calendly. I think it does that too. 

Which is better in your opinion? ü§î
07/02/2025; 13;12 ; Violet Benson; And another thing is not all scheduled calls on my calendar are paid sessions. 

Some might be strategic Partnerhsips; team meetings; etc.
07/02/2025; 13;15 ; Solomon Akinbiyi DAO; if you already have mutuals(prospective business partners) that will lead to something great tomorrow; you could allow them to have free calls with you. But for people who want to get some info and guidance from you they should access you through a paid call
07/02/2025; 13;15 ; Solomon Akinbiyi DAO; Yeah; you could use Calendly
07/02/2025; 13;16 ; Violet Benson; Yes but when it comes to settings; it's not feasible to manually toggle between paid and unpaid links. Unless I haven't explored cal.com properly.
07/02/2025; 13;16 ; Violet Benson; I'll just find a system that works eventually. Looking more like leading to needing separate links to schedule calls.
07/02/2025; 13;19 ; Solomon Akinbiyi DAO; Tbh; I think cal.com is widely used these days. Just check YouTube on how to set the paid calls properly. 
I was recommending Calendly because its founded by a Nigerian. Lol

09/02/2025; 08;56 ; Violet Benson; Saw this from one of my groups and decided to share here;


Hi; hope everyone is doing great today?

I received the following email from a founder and felt inspired to share a key fundraising mistake many founders make. *Even on this platform; many of us introduced ourselves without mentioning our traction* ü§îü§î

Here‚Äôs the email;

;;;;;;;;

Hi [Investor's Name];

I hope you're doing well. I‚Äôm reaching out to introduce [Company Name]; a gamified savings and investment platform designed to make saving effortless and rewarding for young Nigerians.

Millions of young people struggle with saving due to a lack of trust in traditional banks and the absence of engaging financial tools. At [Company Name]; we‚Äôre changing that by blending financial literacy; incentives; and a seamless user experience to drive better savings habits.

We are currently raising $20;000 in a pre;seed round to complete product development and expand [Company Name] to more markets. I‚Äôd love the opportunity to discuss how your investment could help us scale and shape the future of financial inclusion in Nigeria.

Please find our pitch deck attached. Let me know if you‚Äôd be open to a quick call to discuss further.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best;
[Founder‚Äôs Name]


;;;;;;;;;

*The Problem;*

When you read this; you‚Äôll notice the founder jumps from explaining what they do straight to asking for money. *Don't do this.*

Investors have limited time and often decide within 30 seconds whether to keep reading or move on. Your opening should immediately capture their interest by showcasing traction and potential.

Here‚Äôs a better approach;


;;;;;;

Hi [Investor's Name];

I hope you're doing well. I‚Äôm reaching out to introduce [Company Name]; a gamified savings and investment platform designed to make saving effortless and rewarding for young Nigerians.

Since launching X months ago; we‚Äôve onboarded Y users who have collectively saved Z amount; generating MRR of [$X]. Last month; we grew [XX%]; and we‚Äôve recently signed a partnership with [notable company]; giving us access to [target audience].

We are currently raising [$XY] to accelerate growth; with a goal of reaching [YZ users/revenue milestone] within the next 12 months‚Äîpositioning us for our next round at a projected [$AB] valuation.

I‚Äôd love to explore how your experience in [specific expertise] could help us achieve this vision. The team believes that having you on board would be invaluable.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best;
[Founder‚Äôs Name]

;;;;;;;

This structure immediately communicates traction; opportunity; and why the investor should care‚Äîall within the first few sentences. Try it out and see the difference.

15/02/2025; 02;00 ; Violet Benson; ‚ÄúLuck had nothing to do with it‚Äù Quite the opposite actually...

But before I get into that; here's the problem with the luck myth;üëáüèΩ 

1. Lack of visibility; Blind to the hard work and effort that goes into achieving success.

2. Cognitive bias; The tendency to overestimate the role of chance and underestimate the role of skill and effort.

3. Simplistic thinking; Attributing success to luck oversimplifies the complexities of achievement.

...
I'm tired of hearing about how "lucky" a person is when they've accomplished something significant in ‚Äúseemingly‚Äù effortless ways. 

Throughout my life; people have marveled at my ability to attract opportunities and bounce back from adversity. But the truth is none of it was luck.

In fact; growing up; I used to think I was a victim of circumstances. (Blame my AUDHD;inspired hyper;introspection)

But at 15; I made a conscious decision to take control of my life. On one random snort;stained; depressing evening; I wrote down everything I wanted to achieve; and over a decade later; it's good to look back and see that I've crossed every single item off that list.

It wasn't easy. I've struggled for things that others take for granted. Believe it or not. üôÑ

When most assume you're ‚Äúmost definitely‚Äù getting everything handed to you; no one thinks you need help; and that leaves no room for support; leaving you grasping fumes to get ahead. Creating being a real life island princess scenario. Heavy emphasis on the ISLAND. üòÇ 

I've faced setbacks and heavy disappointments that triggered the hyperindependent streak that has now gotten me to this point. And that's what bothers me about the "luck" narrative. 

It undermines the intent; hard work; dedication; and perseverance that is required to get certain shit done.

So; why is the luck myth so pervasive?

Because I think you're having me confused with somebody else.
19/02/2025; 13;13 ; Violet Benson; If you're really a ‚Äúresearcher‚Äù; then I advise you take a course on researching to fully understand the scope of what that is or change careers entirely because what I saw in my DM is clear evidence that you're NOT AT ALL doing any due diligence with researching.
19/02/2025; 13;17 ; Violet Benson; This is what @2348024996347 was referring to with getting associated with bad actors in the space. 

And why we vett service providers here at TDN for business and brands who are looking for world;class talents. 

If you need to be vetted; need to vett talents or your product; please reach out to me or @2349093213098 our community admin. 

Moving forward; we will create stricter measures on the kind of individuals who are allowed in here. 

Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

19/02/2025; 13;35 ; +234 703 295 1044; You have a point and I wouldnt lie it's a challenging thing to do.

 There is a guy I reached out to in one of the groups I belong to to design a logo for me.

I sent the starting amount to this guy to commence the design... he sent his first 3 iterations I didn't like any of them. I told him because of plenty back and forth I told him to send me one so that I could send the balance.


OGA told me I needed to send him the balance before he could send me the completed logo.


I told him; do you understand how business works ; it is based on trust.
1. I haven't met you before; we had our first conversation on WhatsApp and I sent you money to work for me without meeting you.
2. I took on the first risk and now you are doubting me and you don't wanna send me the work.


to cut long story short... oga didn't send me the logo and he didn't refund my moneyüí∂.



There is more we all need to learn as creatives including myself. knowing the skills is one but relating with clients and colleagues is another.


Vetting people is good but how many people can you vet? but it's great to try to fix issues your own way instead of complaining.üßê


The issue is not skill it's soft skill;based.


I am open if you need me to help in any way.

19/02/2025; 13;55 ; Violet Benson; What an awful experience.

But exactly what validates our MVP!!!

Vetting and then matching. 

If you can recall most of the campaigns here highlight the importance of soft skills. 

Personally; I prioritize things like that over hard skills often times because let's be real; any serious person can attain mastery at any skill if they put in their 10;000 hours.

But things like soft skills are often the makers or breakers of partnerships. 

Some people can't handle or manage disputes; or overwhelm; time management or simply lack the ability to see beyond their youthful exuberance (in GenZs case) and how it gets in the way of their success more than limited access; limited resources or poverty. 

As for the vetting; we identified that problem early last year when trying to form the community; and has now become a unique MVP. Not just for talents; but product owners too and microinvestors. 

Now; a product owner might be looking for investors but imagine getting money from someone who's going to stress you so bad that you get performative anxiety that ultimately leads to the failure of the company. This is usually the killer of most ideas and budding startups not essentially incompetent staff. Or micro;investors who aren't multi;millionaires but still look to grow their funds. How can they trust what business; campaigns or brands to invest in when they're not exactly sure how to vett. And remember; some unicorns are not even apparent from the beginning and so investors might lose opportunities out of fear.

Thankfully; some of us here in this community are currently working on a platform that helps others with that. 

Just last night we got approached by another client (who's hiring via the vetting system; for the second time); reach out after a month of scouring the Internet for talents that fit into their checklist. (Budget; skill; management; training; etc) 

And this is evidence to show that it's a real problem that can be fixed.
19/02/2025; 13;56 ; Violet Benson; He wasn't referring to you and you still don't get the point. <This message was edited>
19/02/2025; 13;58 ; Violet Benson; I count care less about your initiative right now considering how you addressed me in that DM which is what I am referring to specifically.

You lack certain soft skills that are most likely getting in the way of your growth right now. 

It's like the proverbial story of the snail in the well that crawls 5 meters every day and slides back down 4 meters at night. 

How you addressed me in the DM is something that might even lead to me calling wherever is in charge of that and telling them that you are completely unfit and unqualified to be working on the corporate world or any team for that matter. <This message was edited>
19/02/2025; 13;59 ; Violet Benson; My reference to your researching was purely thematic as what you wanted was help with research; yet by your actions; it shows clearly that you didn't do due diligence to understand who you were reaching out to and how best to approach them or what to say.
19/02/2025; 13;59 ; +234 813 195 7891; The insight i am talking about is not a course.

19/02/2025; 14;01 ; Violet Benson; The work we do is not a mechanical regurgitation of corporate cloning; if you don't understand and practice it inherently; in your every day life; you will never become a master at it. Or at best; you'll become a mundane task clone. Which is already being overtaken by AI itself. 

Point in case; I'd rather deal with a soulless AI that has a good algorithmic knowledge to know whom theyre addressing and how best to articulate the message than a human who seems to lack that simple and basic corporate awareness.

24/02/2025; 20;30 ; Violet Benson; 90% of startups don‚Äôt fail because of;
Bad marketing; a weak team; or even a poor product. They fail because they lack a repeatable decision;making process.

Here‚Äôs the framework I use to make better; faster decisions in business. I call it ‚ÄúThe Iteration Loop.‚Äù It‚Äôs a structured way to identify what‚Äôs working; what‚Äôs broken; and what to do next; without getting stuck in endless guesswork. It gives you a systematic way to eliminate bottlenecks; optimize execution; and scale with clarity.

Here are the 6 phases;
1. Bottleneck Identification
2. Clarifying the Goal 
3. Solution Brainstorming
4. Focused Execution
5. Performance Review
6. Iterate & Improve

1Ô∏è‚É£ Bottleneck Identification
Before you can fix anything; you need to identify the real problem.
Most entrepreneurs spin their wheels solving the wrong issues because they never dig deep enough. To get clarity; ask;
+ What's the biggest constraint stopping growth right now?
+ What metric; if doubled; would create the biggest impact?
+ What‚Äôs preventing us from getting there?
If you don‚Äôt identify the root problem; every solution you apply will be wasted effort.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Clarifying the Goal
Once you know the problem; define the exact outcome you‚Äôre solving for.
I use a simple Three;Part Goal Formula;
1. What are we trying to achieve?
2. By when?
3. What constraints do we have?
Vague goals lead to vague actions. Precision forces progress.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Solution Brainstorming
Now; generate every possible solution‚Äîwithout filtering. Most people limit themselves to their existing knowledge; which is why they get stuck. Instead; ask; ‚ÄúIf there were no rules; what would I do?‚Äù This opens up better; faster; and often simpler solutions you wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise considered.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Focused Execution
Don‚Äôt test everything at once‚Äîtest one variable at a time. Most teams waste months by making too many changes at once; leading to messy; inconclusive results. Instead; break it down;
1. Test one key assumption.
2. Measure one KPI that proves or disproves it.
3. Execute for a set period; then review.
4. Speed matters. Complexity kills momentum.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Review
Your data isn‚Äôt just numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs feedback on your decision;making process.
Your job is to analyze;
+ Did the solution work?
+ Why or why not?
+ What does this tell us about our business? 
Every test refines your ability to make better future decisions.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Iterate & Improve
Most companies don‚Äôt fail from making the wrong move‚Äîthey fail from making no moves at all. The only way to win long;term is to keep iterating. Instead of fearing failure; build a culture that rewards learning. Failure + Reflection = Progress. If you aren‚Äôt improving your decision;making process; your business will eventually hit a ceiling. That‚Äôs why I built The Iteration Loop‚Äîso every problem becomes an opportunity for better; faster execution.

05/03/2025; 12;00 ; Violet Benson; Errr; not exactly. Especially not for people like us in this part of the world. 

Maybe some might get away with it depending on the level they're at but even the most successful people I know are still obsessed with their goals. 

No Netflix; just YouTube. 

No gossiping just strategy sharing. 

It's like a daily lifestyle now.
05/03/2025; 12;01 ; Violet Benson; For this; imagine watching anime was the same with partying? Would it be so easy to leave it and focus on your goals??

Now; that's not an imagination. It's the same exact thing; ENTERTAINMENT to while away time.
05/03/2025; 12;02 ; Violet Benson; Exactly. It's like asking a machine to have a day off where it's not producing. Bruh; that's your calling man.

07/03/2025; 19;43 ; Violet Benson; *Twitter Space Recap; "AI & Decentralization* 

 _Key Highlights & Replay Link Below_ 



 *KEY DISCUSSIONS*  

1. _Centralized AI Under Fire;_  
; Our DAO Network IT Lead @2347069719374  broke down how Big Tech‚Äôs AI hoards data; comparing it to a "digital dictatorship" ‚Äî highlighting risks like biased algorithms and corporate surveillance.  

2. _Privacy Horror Stories;_  
; A community guest @2348072672678  dropped jaws with real;world examples;  
; Mind;reading tech; AI analyzing brainwaves to predict behavior (conspiracy theory or not?).  
; _Hyper;advanced facial recognition;_ Systems that track emotions and intent (‚ÄúBig Brother meets TikTok‚Äù??).  

3. _Decentralized Hope;_  
; I shared how blockchain and collective governance can;  
; Replace creepy centralized AI with transparent; community;audited models.  
; Encrypt personal data so even the smartest algorithms can‚Äôt exploit it.  


 *TOP TAKEAWAYS*  

; *Your Data = Your Power;* Centralized AI treats you like a product. Decentralization puts you in control.
; *Ethics Matter;* Support open;source AI projects and demand accountability.
; *Stay Skeptical;* If an app claims to ‚Äúread your mood;‚Äù run? 



 *Shoutouts*  
; Huge thanks to space contributors and community members who attended for keeping it 100% real.
; You for asking gems like; ‚ÄúCan we encrypt our thoughts?‚Äù (Spoiler; Not yet‚Ä¶ but decentralization is step one!)

There's actually a project am working on and @2349057895997  asked me to share it here.

The name of the project is BlockEstate a Tokenized real estate dApp
17/03/2025; 21;45 ; +234 905 264 4145; BlockEstate is a Tokenized Real Estate Marketplace ( a decentralized platform ) that allows users to buy; sell; and invest in real estate using blockchain technology. Instead of purchasing an entire property; users can invest in fractional ownership through NFTs or tokens. This enables investors to earn rental income and trade their shares without relying on traditional banks or intermediaries. This platform addresses key real estate challenges such as;

1. High entry costs ‚Äì Users can invest in real estate with small amounts.

2. Slow transactions ‚Äì Smart contracts enable instant ownership transfers.

3. Middlemen fees ‚Äì Eliminates the need for real estate agents and brokers.

4. Lack of liquidity ‚Äì Investors can sell property shares anytime on a secondary marketplace.

Key Features ;

1. Property Tokenization

Real estate properties are converted into NFTs or fractional tokens (ERC;721/ ERC;20). Investors can own a percentage of a property instead of buying the whole house.

2. Smart Contract;Powered Transactions

All property sales and rent payments are handled by secure; self;executing contracts; with transactions recorded on;chain for full transparency.

3. Rental Income Distribution

Property owners earn passive income as smart contracts automatically distribute rent to token holders.

4. Secondary Marketplace for Buying & Selling Shares

Users can sell their shares in a property instead of waiting for the entire property to be sold. Buyers can purchase pre;owned real estate shares at market;driven prices.

5. Blockchain;Based Ownership & Transaction History

Every real estate transaction is recorded on a public blockchain ledger for security and transparency.

Take a look and let me know what you think ü´°
18/03/2025; 01;05 ; Violet Benson; You can share at @120363259851858919@g.us
18/03/2025; 01;09 ; Ifeanyi DAO V.A; Alright thanks a lot
18/03/2025; 01;10 ; Violet Benson; Nice entry. Thing is demos are complete crap...

They never really simulate the actual market conditions.

It's like practicing to be a formal 1 driver on a racing SIM and thinking you've got it. Only to go on field behind an actual McLaren and find that the velocity rate is far different from and sim. Plus the car isn't at all like a racing SIM setup as you'd consider so many factors like tire strength; the other drivers bumping into you; the gas/fuel influence/impact; etc
18/03/2025; 01;12 ; Violet Benson; This is brilliant. Unfortunately without images; people rarely get the picture. üòÇ

Y'all need to understand that the average red time is about 0.02 seconds or so. 

Worse than a goldfish's attention span. 

So; this space is target practice for when you actually pitch investors; shareholders or interested stakeholders

18/03/2025; 08;26 ; Violet Benson; Just wondering... I saw that property owners can enlist their properties. Is that the only method to have a property listed on the platform?

No agents and such?? üòÇüòÇ
18/03/2025; 08;29 ; +234 905 264 4145; Yes no agent ; any person that post property there is basically the owner of the property; even thought some people can still call them selves the owner why they are not and that is the access of the kyc verification using the blockchain before your property can be uploaded
18/03/2025; 08;38 ; Violet Benson; That's amazing!!!

Agents are the real reason houses are spiked here. I've legit seen one advice a property owner to increase their rent just so the % they charge can cost more. 

Only thing is; this platform might not be easily adopted in Nigeria; although other parts of Africa with more advanced interaction with innovative tech like web3 might welcome it more. 

Do you have plans for that? Or it's strictly for the foreign market?
18/03/2025; 08;44 ; Violet Benson; Do you know any talented female full;stack engineers with MERN; AWS; and 3D visualization experience?

We‚Äôre building the next Homestyler alternative and need a founding engineer to own our entire tech stack. Remote position with equity; deferred salary; and other benefits.

They‚Äôll get technical semi;autonomy; flexible schedule; and a path to CTO as we grow.

It‚Äôs an urgent opening; if you know any one; let them reach out me either on;

We're about to start the recruitment exercises for those of you who attended the skills & sourcing event last weekend. 

And even if you weren't there;  this is your opportunity to join in and get hired for active roles from top companies looking to hire as soon as today. 

To keep things lite and fast; here's the plan. 

We're going to have two meetings. 

One for career consultation; we'll join in and each person takes turns to ask their questions. 

If we've answered your question; you can drop off the call. 

The second one will be for resume reviews; everyone joins; and drop the link to their resume in the chats and we'll take turns reviewing them on a first come; first serve basis. 

If your review is over; you can drop off the call.

Here's the link to join the recruitment room; https;//chat.whatsapp.com/CkRzLv34Ood1LDCDknWh6i

12/05/2025; 07;50 ; Violet Benson; Thinking is more important than attempting to fake act confidence because as a man thinking so is he.
12/05/2025; 07;51 ; Violet Benson; This is great advise. 

Also; don't try to compare yourself or goals with others. Your timeline and results are different.

Someone else might genuinely be worse than you but better at sticking to their roadmap.

Comparing; then limits you from your potential which might be even better than the goals you set for yourself.
