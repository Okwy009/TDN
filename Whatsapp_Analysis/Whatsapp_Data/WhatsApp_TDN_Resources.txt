10/12/2024; 14;15 ; Violet Benson; Exactly 💯 

And they get mentally tired. 

That's why we need to build mind muscle not just body.
10/12/2024; 14;18 ; +234 813 195 7891; Omo ;the easiset way to build mind muscle is believing that what you are failing at; there are people successful in it .

The issue is ;you don't know where to find them .

That is why people take advantage of you ;that is why meetup are very good .

Like web3ph did .
10/12/2024; 14;18 ; Violet Benson; Nope. That's too vague.
10/12/2024; 14;19 ; +234 813 195 7891; That was how i built mine .

Moving for roughly 10years without anything to show off.

That was what made me moving till i got the alpha from a dude that attended seminar .
10/12/2024; 14;27 ; Violet Benson; The best ways are to start gathering mind tools. These are some of the things I learned from my mentors; successful friends and my personal experiences below; 👇🏼 

; Meditating. Chill your mind and analyse your decsions often and often.

; Take on new challenges. Get comfy with being uncomfortable.

; Exercise Is also  good for your mood and stuff. Sometimes; when we're down with life's frustrations is when we give up. Exercise teacher syou how to stay resilient. And this one no be skit!!! 

It's REAAALLL. 

; Don't freak out when you fail. Just learn from it. I always tell people I have a solution to find. Rather than I have a problem. Lol. Can you see how the difference in word choice can change my perspective.
; Also; get some sleep . Your brain (and body) will thank you.
; Focus on the good stuff. Practice gratitude. This year alone; I've helped people navigate frustration by introducing them to journaling. Start penning down your thoughts. You can always burn it later. 
; Try new things. Travel; learn; hobby;ize... The more you engage in; the more opportunities you get. By virtue of the things you learn; the people you meet; or the lessons from each thing. 
; Last but not least; be kind to yourself. No beating yourself up; okay?

That's it. Easy peasy.
10/12/2024; 14;55 ; Kenechukwu CEO; I need this inspiring words more than anyone especially now that things are not balanced 🤔. Thank you so much boss 🙏
10/12/2024; 15;01 ; Violet Benson; Raid this post y'all 😁 💪🏼

10/12/2024; 15;04 ; Violet Benson; See why it's good to be amongst like minds?

Sometimes; if you don't have anything to give; it's fine. You might see a lot to receive. So stay and receive.
10/12/2024; 15;06 ; Kenechukwu CEO; Perfect and great advice 👌. Thank you so much 🙏

15/12/2024; 22;52 ; Violet Benson; Speaking of AI; I've noticed that many people aren't automating tasks enough and so life becomes increasingly “difficult” with so much to handle as a digital creator; etc. But it's mostly because they're not fluent in the tech stacks that have been designed to help make these things a lot easier in this jet age. 

Simply because they're biased; ignorant or don't trust in the ability of a supersonic processor; but would rely on traditional processors like our dear old brain. Or they haven't the time; patience or energy to setup; learn or start acquainting themselves with these tools. 

For example; 👇🏼
